                <p>
                    At a early age I was put in honors classes and was told I was smart.
                    I didnt perform well in school grade wise until 5th grade when my grades started shooting up.
                    I did the best in math which would follow me up to now.

                <h2> Current Education</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of high school I struggled since it was online. It made me learn my limits
                    and actually try in school. When school went back in person I started doing well again.
                    I realized the specific field I wanted to get into was game development
                    so I started learning a bit of Python on my own time and understood it well, but I gave up.
                    I needed to complete a pathway to graduate so I decided to get a Computer Science class
                    since it was interesting to me. In my Senior year I decided to take AP Computer Science,
                    Digital Animation, and Graphic Communications since it would help me in the field I wanted to get into.

                <h2> College and University Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to major in Game Development (computer science as a backup)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on attending a university that teaches game development, isn't too expensive, doesn't require a car to navigate the area.
                    Some of my top options are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Michigan State University (MSU) - Lansing,MI </li>
                    <li>University of Denver - Denver,CO </li>
                    <li>University of Utah - Salt Lake City,UT</li>
